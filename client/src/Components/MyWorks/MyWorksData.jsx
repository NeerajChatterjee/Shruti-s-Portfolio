It did not have sufficient computing power for some of the projects his students had conceptualized, and it was pretty expensive.",

After 50 trials, the computer taught itself to differentiate cards marked at the left from cards marked at the proper. It confirmed the “perceptron” - “the primary device that successfully got a unique idea,” according to its creator, Frank Rosenblatt.",
